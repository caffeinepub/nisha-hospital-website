  "summary": "Frontend adds routed public pages with a shared header/footer, themed styling, seed data for News & Events, and a Contact form that calls a new backend submitInquiry method. Backend adds inquiry submission and admin-only inquiry listing, but does not meet stable persistence and inquiry record shape/ordering requirements; it also introduces additional access control/user profile features not requested.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-4",
      "requirement": "Store contact form submissions (inquiries) in stable state and expose methods to create a new inquiry and list inquiries in reverse chronological order, with each inquiry including at least: id, createdAt timestamp, name, email, subject, message.",
      "reason": "Backend inquiries are stored in a non-stable var array, inquiry records have no id and use `timestamp` instead of a createdAt field, and `getInquiries()` returns the array as-is (not reversed/newest-first).",

      "reason": "Frontend references the required filenames, but the diff summary does not show the actual image files added under `frontend/public/assets/generated` (some files are omitted due to limits), so their presence cannot be verified from the provided diff summary.",
